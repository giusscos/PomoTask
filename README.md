# PomoTask - Progressive Timer

I developed a Progressive Pomodoro Timer app for iOS using Swift, designed to enhance productivity by allowing users to track tasks and customize background designs for better focus during each Pomodoro session. In addition to the core timer functionality, the app features note-taking capabilities, enabling users to document their tasks as they progress. The custom-built user interface provides a smooth and intuitive experience. The progressive timer helps users gradually build the focus they need for daily activities and Pomodoro sessions.
